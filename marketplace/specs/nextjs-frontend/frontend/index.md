# Frontend Index

Read this before Next.js work.

## Common Shape

```text
app/             # App Router routes, layouts, metadata, route handlers
components/      # Reusable UI and page sections
data/            # Static typed content when the project is content-driven
hooks/           # Client hooks
lib/             # Shared helpers, config, SEO, validation, analytics
public/          # Static assets
scripts/         # Maintenance scripts
docs/            # Maintainer docs when present
```

## Rules

- Read the project root `DESIGN.md` before any UI work.
- If no `DESIGN.md` exists and the task changes visual design, choose a suitable
  design-md starting point before coding.
- Keep route files aligned with Next conventions: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`,
  `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, and `route.ts`.
- Keep server-only logic out of client components.
- Keep browser-only APIs out of server components.
- Use typed helpers for route data, content records, and shared config.
- Put reusable UI in `components/`; put page-specific composition near the page
  or in clearly named page-section components.
- Do not introduce Prisma, a database, or API routes for a pure frontend need.

## Before Editing

- Read the target project's README and docs.
- Check `package.json` scripts.
- Inspect existing route groups and component naming before adding new files.
